# Library Management Console Application :books:

## Context :book:

The municipal library of the city of Paris is encountering several challenges related to manual book management and the absence of an efficient tracking system. These issues include:

- **Inefficient Management**: Librarians have to perform all book-related tasks manually, leading to errors and time loss. Maintaining an updated database and tracking book status (available or borrowed) is challenging.
- **Search Difficulties**: Library users struggle to find the books they want to borrow due to the lack of an effective search system, resulting in a discouraging experience.
- **Lack of Statistics**: There's no easy way to obtain statistics on available, borrowed, or lost books, limiting the library's ability to optimize its collection.

In response, we are developing a Java-based console application to address these challenges. This application aims to provide automated book management, efficient search, borrowing and returning management, and the generation of statistical reports. Our goal is to enhance the user experience while solving issues related to inefficient management and search difficulties.

## Requirements :clipboard:

To address these challenges, the library requires a library management console application with the following features:

- **Automated Book Management**: Librarians can add new books, update existing book information, and remove books from the database.
- **Efficient Search System**: Users can quickly search for books by title or author.
- **Borrowing and Returning Management**: Librarians can record book borrowings and returns, tracking each book's status.
- **Generation of Statistical Reports**: The application generates reports on available, borrowed, and lost books, enabling informed decision-making.

## User Stories :busts_in_silhouette:

As a user, I want to:

- :heavy_plus_sign: Add a new book to the library by providing its title, author, and ISBN.

## Implementation :computer:

This application will be developed in Java, offering librarians and users an effective solution to the challenges faced by the municipal library of Paris. The console-based interface will ensure ease of use and quick access to various functionalities.

Feel free to contribute to this project and help improve the library experience for both staff and users! :raised_hands:
